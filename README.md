Supporting our Strategic Priorities

Python is one of the most powerful, easy to read and easy to learn programming languages around. Following successful Python coding clubs in 2020, we are bringing back this initiative for 2021 to support all offices in the Australia region.

Everyone is invited and encouraged to attend this lunch and learn session on coding, and coding clubs.
